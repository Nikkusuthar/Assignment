    <p><b>1. What are the advantages of Bootstrap? </b></p>
    <p>ans: Top 10 Advantages of Bootstrap for Web Development are as below:</p>
    <ol>
    <li> Easy initiation: <br>
    Coding is a hurricane task for a person who is unbeknownst to web development. But the greatest use of Bootstrap in web development is it makes 
    coding hassle-free. <br> Bootstrap handles everything for you. Despite having no extensive knowledge of coding, one can design an enticing landing page 
    using Bootstrap. <br> The only criterion is to have moderate experience of CSS and HTML. Alongside this, the integration process of Bootstrap is easy on
    existing and newer websites. <br> In your current CSS, you can incorporate diverse platforms, frameworks, elements of Bootstrap without any hassles.</li>
 
   <li> Responsiveness <br>
   Statistics highlight over 6.4 billion smartphone users worldwide. This study infers smartphone penetration of over 80 percent. <br> And the numbers do
   not stop here; in fact, they are rising rapidly. Due to this extensive demand, having a mobile-responsive website has become a prerequisite, and this
   task is a cakewalk with Bootstrap by your side. <br> It has a fluid grid layout, which adapts as per the screen resolution.
</li>

  <li>Highly customizable <br>
   You can find an array of templates in Bootstrap. However, if you find them unappealing, you can concoct your customization using the CSS file. <br>
   Besides, if you cannot spare time to start everything from scratch, you can blend the customization with the existing code and enhance the functionality. <br>
   All this can be undertaken under the customization page.
</li> 

  <li> Extremely user-centric <br>
   While creating landing pages, it is very important to design from the user’s point of view. If a landing page is engaging, only then does it appeal to the
   audience. <br> One of the prominent advantages of Bootstrap is you can design landing pages complementing the audience’s requirements. It comes up with
   suggestions regarding elements like photos, Call-to-actions (CTA) that look best for your audience and enhance user experience. <br> Moreover, it helps in 
   making easy edits to the landing page elements for reaching out to more audiences. </li> 

  <li>Top-notch support <br>
   When using Bootstrap, the only requirement is basic knowledge of coding. However, as a newbie, you might come across an array of problems. <br>
   It might lead to hesitancy when using Bootstrap. To overcome this problem, Bootstrap comes with a huge support community. <br> Having a support
   community is a blessing in disguise when using any technology. <br> You get answers to every query. You share the query, and the community will actively 
   help in solving it. 
</li> 
  <li> Cross-browser compatibility <br>
  Every user is different, and so is their device. Along with the device, they use varied browsers too. Bootstrap is compatible with the latest versions 
  of all modern browsers and platforms. One of the biggest advantages of using Bootstrap is compatibility across browsers. <br> With Bootstrap by your side, 
  heave a sigh of relief when it comes to displaying your landing page across multiple browsers. <br> Its compatibility with Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and 
  Internet Explorer makes it more versatile. 
</li>

 <li> JavaScript plugins to your rescue <br>
  To make the pages more interactive, one needs elements, like sliders, drop-down menus, tabs, etc. The hunt begins to find complementing plugins to
  include these elements. <br> But with Bootstrap by your side, you can easily incorporate these components as numerous JavaScript plugins are bundled in 
  the Bootstrap package. <br> Also, adding these functionalities is easy as you just need to write a few lines of code and you are all set. Moreover, with the 
 customization option, you have the liberty to choose particular plugins, helping to maintain minimize file size. <br>
 Besides, the creators are always on their toes updating Bootstrap to offer a better experience to the users. With this, you can always avail the best 
  assistance in every circumstance.
</li>
<li> Far-reaching popularity <br>
  The most crucial advantage of using Bootstrap is its widespread presence. A multinational and global company like Apple utilizes Bootstrap for its Apple
   Maps and Apple Music web apps. <br> Not just this, but Dropbox, Coursera, and Airbnb have acknowledged the prowess of Bootstrap and are using it to
    maintain robustness.
</li>
 <li> Ample documentation <br>
  When using a framework, the support from the community is priceless, but some prefer referring to written notes. Fortunately, Bootstrap satiates
   this requirement by providing easy-to-read and efficient documentation on the Bootstrap website. <br> The framework is easy, and the documentation 
   makes it easier to work on UI designing.
</li>
  <li> Updates at the doorstep  <br>
  Staying updated is the core of any technology. The same thumb rule applies to Bootstrap, which is fully attuned. <br> Its core developers constantly keep the
  framework updated. <br> They keep a close eye on future web requirements and make changes accordingly. Whenever there is a new update, Bootstrap
  considers the users to get hold of the latest and most advanced technology available in the industry. <br>
  So, these are some vital reasons to use Bootstrap for your web development projects. Apart from this, it offers a chaos-free ambiance and minimal
  coding, making it extremely easy for a newbie to utilize it. Choosing this framework will ease your life and complement all your requirements. <br> Moreover,
  if you wish to learn it, then enroll in the best web development course in Pune for productive results.

<p><b>2. What is a Bootstrap Container, and how does it work? </b></p>
<p>ans: Containers are a fundamental building block of Bootstrap that contain, pad, and align your content within a given device or viewport. <br>
    Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are required when using our default grid system. <br> Containers are used to contain, pad, 
     and (sometimes) center the content within them. While containers can be nested, most layouts do not require a nested container. <br>
     Bootstrap comes with three different containers: <br>
   . container, which sets a max-width at each responsive breakpoint <br>
   . container-fluid, which is width: 100% at all breakpoints <br>
   . container-{breakpoint}, which is width: 100% until the specified breakpoint <br>
  => Responsive containers allow you to specify a class that is 100% wide until the specified breakpoint is reached, after which we apply max-widths for
    each of the higher breakpoints. <br> For example, .container-sm is 100% wide to start until the sm breakpoint is reached, where it will scale up with md, 
    lg, xl, and xxl. <br>

   => here are all the containers : <br>
    &lt;div class="container-sm">100% wide until small breakpoint &lt;/div&gt; <br>
      &lt;div class="container-md">100% wide until medium breakpoint &lt;/div&gt; <br>
      &lt;div class="container-lg">100% wide until large breakpoint &lt;/div&gt; <br>
      &lt;div class="container-xl">100% wide until extra large breakpoint &lt;/div&gt; <br>
      &lt;div class="container-xxl">100% wide until extra extra large breakpoint &lt;/div&gt; <br>

   => Use .container-fluid for a full width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport. <br>
</p> <br> <br>

<p><b>3. What are the default Bootstrap text settings? </b></p>
<p>Bootstrap 4 uses a default font-size of 16px, and its line-height is 1.5. <br>
    The default font-family is "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif. <br>
    In addition, all &lt;p&gt;  elements have margin-top: 0 and margin-bottom: 1rem (16px by default).
</p> <br> <br>

<p><b>4. What do you know about the Bootstrap Grid System? </b></p>
<p>ans : Containers provide a means to center and horizontally pad your site’s contents. Use .container for a responsive pixel width or .container-fluid for 
    width: 100% across all viewport and device sizes. <br>
   =>Rows are wrappers for columns. Each column has horizontal padding (called a gutter) for controlling the space between them. This padding is then 
      counteracted on the rows with negative margins. <br> This way, all the content in your columns is visually aligned down the left side. <br>
   => In a grid layout, content must be placed within columns and only columns may be immediate children of rows. <br>
   => Thanks to flexbox, grid columns without a specified width will automatically layout as equal width columns. For example, four instances of .col-sm 
       will each automatically be 25% wide from the small breakpoint and up. See the auto-layout columns section for more examples. <br>
   => Column classes indicate the number of columns you’d like to use out of the possible 12 per row. So, if you want three equal-width columns across, 
      you can use .col-4. <br>
   => Column widths are set in percentages, so they’re always fluid and sized relative to their parent element. <br>
   => Columns have horizontal padding to create the gutters between individual columns, however, you can remove the margin from rows and padding
      from columns with .no-gutters on the .row. <br>
   =>To make the grid responsive, there are five grid breakpoints, one for each responsive breakpoint: all breakpoints (extra small), small, medium, large,
      and extra large. <br>
   => Grid breakpoints are based on minimum width media queries, meaning they apply to that one breakpoint and all those above it <br>
      (e.g., .col-sm-4 applies to small, medium, large, and extra large devices, but not the first xs breakpoint). <br>
   => You can use predefined grid classes (like .col-4) or Sass mixins for more semantic markup. <br>
   => Auto-layout for flexbox grid columns also means you can set the width of one column and have the sibling columns automatically resize around it. <br>
       You may use predefined grid classes (as shown below), grid mixins, or inline widths. Note that the other columns will resize no matter the width 
       of the center column. <br>
    => When using Bootstrap’s source Sass files, you have the option of using Sass variables and mixins to create custom, semantic, and responsive page
      layouts. Our predefined grid classes use these same variables and mixins to provide a whole suite of ready-to-use classes for fast responsive layouts. <br>
   => Variables and maps determine the number of columns, the gutter width, and the media query point at which to begin floating columns. We use
      these to generate the predefined grid classes documented <br>
   => Using our built-in grid Sass variables and maps, it’s possible to completely customize the predefined grid classes. Change the number of tiers,
      the media query dimensions, and the container widths—then recompile.
</p> <br> <br>

<p><b>5. What is the difference between Bootstrap 4 and Bootstrap 5 </b></p>
<p> <ol>
    <li> Vanilla JavaScript instead of jQuery : <br>
    => Ever since Bootstrap was introduced, it utilized jQuery as a dependency to offer dynamic features such as menu expansion, carousel, dropdowns etc. <br>
       However, this forced dependency on jQuery was not liked by many developers who wanted to use Bootstrap with modern JavaScript frameworks 
       such as React and Vue.js. With Bootstrap 5, they have removed this dependency. <br>
    => Note that this does not mean that there is no JavaScript dependency in Bootstrap 5. Behaviors such as dropdown, slider, popover etc. in 
       Bootstrap 5 depends on Popper as well as its own vanilla JavaScript module. There will be no requirement of adding jQuery. If your project depends
       on jQuery, you can still add it. </li> <br>
    <li> Browser support – IE 10 and 11 support removed : <br>
    =>With Microsoft moving its efforts completely towards Edge browser, Internet Explorer is fast losing market share. Moreover, Edge has adopted the 
      open source chromium engine which allows it to have all the modern JavaScript and CSS features on par with latest version of Chrome and Firefox. <br>
      Given this, Bootstrap team has dropped support for Internet Explorer which allows it to provide a modern set of features such as CSS variables, faster
      JavaScript and better APIs. </li>
     
     <li> CSS custom properties : <br>
    => Thanks to dropping support for Internet Explorer, Bootstrap 5 now supports custom CSS properties. In Bootstrap 4 root variables were present
      for only color and fonts. <br> Bootstrap 5 now offers CSS variables in a handful of components and layout options. For example, table component makes 
      use of local variables to make striped, hover-able, and active table styles easier.</li>

     <li> Expanded color palette <br>   
    => Many CSS frameworks such as Tailwind offer an extensive set of color palette which has been quite popular with developers. <br> Bootstrap 5 has now 
     expanded its color palette to include more colors that are present in different shades such as $blue-100, $blue-200, $blue-300, …., $blue-900. <br> This
     allows you to easily customize the look and feel of your app without ever leaving the codebase. You can easily override these colors with your own color
      palette using the color shades generator. </li>

     <li> Updated Form Controls <br>
    => Bootstrap 5 includes custom designed form controls. In Bootstrap 4 the form controls were using whatever defaults each browser provided. <br> In 
      Bootstrap 5 the form controls will offer much more consistent look and feel in all browsers due to its custom design. </li>

     <li> Utilities API <br>
    => A new utility API has been built into Bootstrap 5. You can use Sass to create your own utilities. You can also use the utility API of Bootstrap to 
      modify or remove the default utility classes. </li>

     <li> Enhanced grid system <br>
     => While Bootstrap 5 keeps the grid system structure that was introduced in Bootstrap 4, it enhances it by adding new classes. <br> This would mean less 
      effort will be required to move the grid structure from the older to newer version. </li>
   
      <li> CSS Grid Support <br>
     => Bootstrap 5 has introduced an experimental version of CSS Grid as an opt-in replacement to the default grid system. Using it is not mandatory, 
       however those who prefect CSS Grid over Flexbox would like it. </li>

     <li>New offcanvas component and Navbar Offcanvas <br>
      => A new offcanvas component has been added in Bootstrap 5 which can be used to create expanding sidebars for navigation or for shopping carts 
      or offcanvas menu. <br> These offcanvas components can be placed on the left, right, or bottom of the viewport and can be configured with data attributes
       or the JavaScript APIs. </li> 

    <li> New accordion <br>
     =>Bootstrap 5 adds support for brand new .accordion component. The new accordion includes Bootstrap Icons as chevron icons indicating state and 
       click-ability. <br> You can also use .accordion-flush to remove the default background-color, some borders, and some rounded corners to render accordions 
       edge-to-edge with their parent container. </li>

       <li>Floating labels in Form Inputs <br>
     =>A new floating label support has also been added in bootstrap 5. This behavior is similar to the behavior shown by many material design UI frameworks
       such as MDB. <br> Form validation styles also work as expected with floating labels present.
    </li> 
    </ol>
</p> <br> <br>

<p><b>6. What is a Button Group, and what is the class for a basic Button Group? </b></p>
<p>ans : “Button Groups” in Bootstrap is a class of name “btn-group” which is used to create series of buttons in groups (without spaces) vertically or
    horizontally. <br>
   This is the basic syntax of the button group class where each button has its own class of “btn”. <br>
  => &lt;div class="btn-group"&gt; <br>
        &lt;button type="button" class="btn">Click&lt;/button&gt; <br>
     &lt;/div&gt; <br>
   => Buttons have a default border-radius on the first and last buttons of the group. <br>
   => Adding Styles on Buttons: Bootstrap allows you to add styles to your buttons using the following classes: <br>
   => .btn-default <br>
      * .btn-primary <br>
      * .btn-success <br>
      * .btn-info <br>
      * .btn-warning <br>
      * .btn-danger <br>
      * .btn-link <br>

   => Sizing of your Buttons: Bootstrap provides 4 button sizes which you can add directly to your buttons by
    adding an additional class of “btn-group-*” to your “btn-group” class. No need to add separate classes to each button. <br>
   => Vertical Button Groups: Bootstrap also supports vertical button groups stacked in a vertical manner rather than horizontal. <br>
     Use the class “btn-group-vertical” to create a vertical button group: <br>
   => Nesting of Buttons: Bootstrap allows you to create dropdown menus under your buttons through nesting. Add a class of 
      “btn-group” within your main “btn-group” class to have a dropdown menu within your button:
</p> <br> <br>

<p><b>7. How can you use Bootstrap to make thumbnails? </b></p>
<p>ans: Bootstrap helps web developers to create thumbnails that are used to show linked images in grids with the pre-defined classes which help to reduce 
    codes length. <br> Thumbnails are created to provide a quick preview of images with small images.
   =>Thumbnail Image: A thumbnail is a small image that represents a larger image. Bootstrap has an easy way to do this with thumbnails. Bootstrap’s . <br>
    thumbnail class is used to show linked images in grids (grid system), a thumbnail is created using class .thumbnail within the element &lt;a&gt;. <br>
    The class .col-sm-* and .col-md-* (where * represent number ), it is used to create grids of the images. <br>
   => Step 1: Include Bootstrap and jQuery CDN into the &lt;head&gt; tag before all other stylesheets to load our CSS. <br>
   => Step 2: Add &lt;div&gt; tag in the HTML body with class row. In that &lt;div&gt; create four div sections to create four images. <br>
   =>Step 3: Add “col-sm-6” and “col-md-3” to four div sections which creates webpage responsive. <br>
   =>Step 4: Add  &lt;a&gt; tag with class value thumbnail to define the link of the image in the next line. <br> 

  => Adding captions and buttons to the thumbnails : <br>

     -> Step 1: We created div with class value as thumbnail and inserted image, after that add div with class .caption to define the description of the <br>
         images &lt;p&gt;. <br>
     -> Step 2: Create buttons using  &lt;a&gt; tag with class . btn .btn-success. <br>
</p> <br><br>


<p><b>8. In Bootstrap 4, what is flexbox? </b></p>
<p>ans: The biggest difference between Bootstrap 3 and Bootstrap 4 is that Bootstrap 4 now uses flexbox, instead of floats, to handle the layout. <br>
    =>The Flexible Box Layout Module, makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning. If you are new to flex, <br>
       you can read about it in our CSS Flexbox Tutorial. <br>
     => Set the direction of flex items in a flex container with direction utilities. In most cases you can omit the horizontal class here as the browser default <br>
        is row. However, you may encounter situations where you needed to explicitly set this value (like responsive layouts). <br>
     => Justify content <br>
     =>Use justify-content utilities on flexbox containers to change the alignment of flex items on the main axis (the x-axis to start, y-axis if flex-direction: 
        column). <br>
      =>  Choose from start (browser default), end, center, between, or around. <br>
      => Align items <br>
    Use align-items utilities on flexbox containers to change the alignment of flex items on the cross axis (the y-axis to start, x-axis if flex-direction: column). <br>
       Choose from start, end, center, baseline, or stretch (browser default). <br>
      => Align self <br>
      =>Use align-self utilities on flexbox items to individually change their alignment on the cross axis (the y-axis to start, x-axis if flex-direction: column). <br>
        Choose from the same options as align-items: start, end, center, baseline, or stretch (browser default). <br>
      => Auto margins <br>
       Flexbox can do some pretty awesome things when you mix flex alignments with auto margins. Shown below are three examples of controlling flex <br>
       items via auto margins: default (no auto margin), pushing two items to the right (.mr-auto), and pushing two items to the left (.ml-auto). <br>
       => With align-items <br>
         Vertically move one flex item to the top or bottom of a container by mixing align-items, flex-direction: column, and margin-top: auto or margin-bottom: auto. <br>

        => Wrap <br>
          Change how flex items wrap in a flex container. Choose from no wrapping at all (the browser default) with .flex-nowrap, wrapping with .flex-wrap, or
          reverse wrapping with .flex-wrap-reverse. <br>
         => Order <br>
          Change the visual order of specific flex items with a handful of order utilities. We only provide options for making an item first or last, as well as a
          reset to use the DOM order. As order takes any integer value (e.g., 5), add custom CSS for any additional values needed. <br>
         => Align content <br>
           Use align-content utilities on flexbox containers to align flex items together on the cross axis. Choose from start (browser default), end, center, between, around, 
          or stretch. To demonstrate these utilities, we’ve enforced flex-wrap: wrap and increased the number of flex items.
</p> <br> <br>

<p><b>9. How can one create an alert in Bootstrap? </b></p>
<p>ans :  Bootstrap Alerts are used to provide an easy way to create predefined alert messages. Alert adds a style to your messages to make it more appealing to the users. <br>
    => There are four classes that are used within &lt;div&gt; element for alerts.
   .alert-success <br>
   .alert-info <br>
   .alert-warning <br>
   .alert-danger <br>

  => Approach: <br>
  => The .alert class followed by contextual classes are used to display the alert message on website. The alert classes are: .alert-success, .alert-info, .alert-warning, . <br>
     alert-danger, .alert-primary, .alert-secondary, .alert-light and .alert-dark. We can use .alert-warning to create warning notification alerts in bootstrap. <br>

   => Below is the procedure to implement a simple warning alert in Bootstrap. <br>
   Step 1: Include Bootstrap and jQuery CDN into the &lt;head&gt; tag before all other stylesheets to load our CSS. <br>
   Step 2: Add the .alert and the warning alert contextual classes (e.g., .alert-warning). <br>
</p> <br> <br>


<p><b>10. What is a bootstrap card and how would you create one? </b></p>
<p>ans : A card is a flexible and extensible content container. It includes options for headers and footers, a wide variety of content, contextual background colors, and 
    powerful display options. If you're familiar with Bootstrap 3, cards replace our old panels, wells, and thumbnails. <br>
 => A card in Bootstrap 4 is a bordered box with some padding around its content. It includes options for headers, footers, content, colors, etc. <br>
 => A basic card is created with the .card class, and content inside the card has a .card-body class: <br>
 => Contextual Cards <br>
  To add a background color the card, use contextual classes (.bg-primary, .bg-success, .bg-info, .bg-warning, .bg-danger, .bg-secondary, .bg-dark and .bg-light. <br>
 => Use .card-title to add card titles to any heading element. The .card-text class is used to remove bottom margins for a &lt;p&gt; element if it is the last child
    (or the only one) inside .card-body. The .card-link class adds a blue color to any link, and a hover effect. <br>
 => Cards require a small amount of markup and classes to provide you with as much control as possible. These classes and markup are flexible though and can 
    typically be remixed and extended with ease. For example, if your card has no flush content like images, feel free to put the .card-block class on the .card element
    to consolidate your markup. <br>
  => Bootstrap card is a flexible and extensible content container. It includes options for headers and footers, a wide variety of content, contextual background colors,
       and powerful display options. Card replaces panel, well, and thumbnail components in old Bootstrap 3 version. <br>
   => Creating a Basic Card :=> <br>

       The card markup is pretty straight forward. The outer wrapper require the base class .card, whereas content can be placed inside the .card-body element. <br>
        The following example will show you how to create a card with a picture, mixed with some text content and a button. <br>

       -> &lt;div class="card" style="width: 300px;"&gt; <br>
                    &lt;img src="images/sample.svg" class="card-img-top" alt="..."&gt; <br>
                  &lt;div class="card-body text-center"&gt; <br>
                 &lt;h5 class="card-title"&gt;Alice Liddel&lt;/h5&gt; <br>
                &lt;p class="card-text"&gt;Alice is a freelance web designer and developer based in London. She is specialized in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap, etc.&lt;/p&gt; <br>
               &lt;a href="#" class="btn btn-primary"&gt;View Profile&lt;/a&gt; <br>
