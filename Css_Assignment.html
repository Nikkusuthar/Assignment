            for compatibility, running the program across multiple browsers.</li>
        <li> There exists a scarcity of security.</li>
        <li> After making the changes we need to confirm the compatibility if they appear. The similar change affects on
            all the browsers.</li>
        <li> The programing language world is complicated for non-developers and beginners. Different levels of CSS i.e.
            CSS, CSS 2, CSS 3 are often quite confusing.</li>
        <li> Browser compatibility (some styles sheet are supported and some are not).</li>

        <li> The CSS3 version supports more browsers than CSS2.</li>
        <li> CSS3 introduces several new selectors. Those new selectors square measure largely in an exceeding type of
            pseudo-elements and pseudo-categories.</li>

            through diacritic (~) combinator.</li>
        <li> CSS3 introduces several properties attended with new values and units. It facilitates styling of
            backgrounds, borders, boxes, etc…, that permits the USA to stay most of the styling at intervals the
            computer network and HTML standards and our document, while not a necessity for all those proprietary
            third-party package packages.</li>

    <p>= To add background color in HTML, use the CSS background-color property. Set it to the color name or code you
        want and place it inside a style attribute. <br>
        Then add this style attribute to an HTML element, like a table, heading, div, or span tag.
    </p><br>

        image will display only once.</p><br>

    <p>There are two reasons behind this: It enhances the legibility of style sheets. The background property is a
        complex property in CSS, and if it is combined with color, the complexity will further increase.</p><br>

    <p><b>11. How to center block elements using CSS1?</b></p>
    <p>Center block elements using margin property: We need to specify the margin from left and right such that it looks
        centered. We do not need to do this manually, we have one property value “auto” which will automatically set the
        margin such that our block element is placed in the center.</p><br>

    <p>CSS stylesheets can be applied to an HTML document in 3 ways – inline styles, embedded stylesheet, and external
        stylesheet. <br>
        Embedded Stylesheet: It allows you to define styles for a particular HTML document as a whole in one place
    </p><br>

    <p><b>15. What are the external style sheets?</b></p>
    <p>To apply a rule to multiple pages, an external style sheet is used. An external style sheet is a separate CSS
        file that can be accessed by creating a link within the head section of the webpage. Multiple webpages can use
        the same link to access the stylesheet.
        The link to an external style sheet is placed within the head section of the page. <br>
        &lt;head&gt; <br>
        &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mystyle.css"&gt; <br>
        &lt;/head&gt; <br>
    </p><br>

        In External Style Sheets, Classes can be made for use on numerous HTML element types in many forms of the site.
        In complex contexts, Methods like selector and grouping can be implemented to apply styles. <br>
        = The disadvantages of External Style Sheets are as follows : <br>
        An extra download is essential to import style information for each file.
        The execution of the file may be deferred till the external style sheet is loaded.
        While implementing style sheets, we need to test Web pages with multiple browsers in order to check
        compatibility issues.

    <p><b>17. What is the meaning of the CSS selector?</b></p>
    <p>CSS selector is the first part of a CSS Rule. It is a pattern of elements and other terms that tell the browser
