        <p><b>1. What is JavaScript?</b></p>
        <p>= JavaScript is a lightweight scripting and programming language that web developers commonly use to create
            more dynamic interactions when developing web pages, applications, servers, and or even games. <br>
            every time a web page does more than <br>
            just sit there and display static information for you to look at. displaying timely content updates,
            interactive maps ,animated 3d/2d graphics ,scrolling videos jukeboxes etc.
        </p><br>


        <p><b>2. What is the use of isNuN function ?</b></p>
        <p>= Full form of NaN funcion is Not a Number. The isNaN () function is used to check whether a given value is
            an illegal number or not. It returns true if value is a NaN else returns false. It is different from the
            Number.isNaN () Method.</p><br>


        <p><b>3. What is negative Infinity ?</b></p>
        <p>= The negative infinity in JavaScript is a constant value which is used to represent a value which is the
            lowest available. This means that no other number is
            lesser than this value. It can be generated using a self-made function or by an arithmetic operation. <br>
            - Negative infinity is different from mathematical infinity in the following ways: <br>
            - Negative infinity results in 0 when divided by any other number. <br>
            - When divided by itself or positive infinity, negative infinity return NaN <br>
            - Negative infinity, when divided by any positive number (apart from positive infinity) is negative
            infinity. <br>
            - Negative infinity, divided by any negative number (apart from negative infinity) is positive infinity.
            <br>
            - If we multiply negative infinity with NaN, we will get NaN as a result. <br>
            - The product of NaN and negative infinity is 0. <br>
            - The product of two negative infinities is always a positive infinity. <br>
        </p><br>

        <p><b>4. Which compony developed Javascript?</b></p>
        <p>= JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995. <br>
            It was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997. <br>
            After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to develop JavaScript for
            the Firefox browser. <br>
            Mozilla's latest version was 1.8.5. (Identical to ES5). <br>
            Internet Explorer (IE4) was the first browser to support ECMA-262 Edition 1 (ES1). <br>
        </p><br>

        <p><b>5. What are undeclared and undefined variables?</b></p>
        <p>= Undefined variable means a variable has been declared but does not have a value. <br>
            Undeclared variable means that the variable does not exist in the program at all.
        </p><br>

        <p><b>6. Write the code for adding new elements dynamically ?</b></p>
        <p>= New elements can be created in JS by using the createElement() method. <br>
            let newElement = document.createElement("&lt;createdElement&gt;"); <br>
            This code will add the new element inside the programme.
        </p><br>


        <p><b>7. What is the defference between Viewstate and SessionState?</b></p>
        <p>Session State contains information that is pertaining to a specific session (by a particular
            client/browser/machine) with the server. <br>
            It's a way to track what the user is doing on the site.. across multiple pages...amid the statelessness of
            the Web. e.g. the contents of a
            particular user's shopping cart is session data. Cookies can be used for session state. <br>
            View State on the other hand is information specific to particular web page. It is stored in a hidden field
            so that it isn't visible to the user. <br>
            It is used to maintain the user's illusion that the page remembers what he did on it the last time - dont
            give him a clean page every time he posts back. <br>
        </p><br>

        <p><b>8. What is === operator?</b></p>
        <p>= The strict equality operator (===) checks whether its two operands are equal, returning a Boolean result.
            Unlike the equality operator, the strict equality <br>
            operator always considers operands of different types to be different. <br>
            Examples: <br>
            console.log(1 === 1); <br>
            expected output: true <br>
            console.log('hello' === 'hello'); <br>
            expected output: true <br>
            console.log('1' === 1); <br>
            expected output: false <br>
        </p><br>

        <p><b>9. How can style/class of an Element be changed ?</b></p>
        <p> Approach 1: <br>
            Changing CSS with the help of the style property:=> <br>
            => document.getElementById("id").style.property = new_style <br>
            Approach 2: <br>
            (1) Changing the class itself – We can use two properties that can be used to manipulate the classes. <br>
            => document.getElementById("id").classList <br>
            (2) The className Property: This property is used to set the current class of the element to the specified
            class. <br>
            => document.getElementById("id").className = class <br>
        </p><br>

        <p><b>10. How to read and write the file using Javascript?</b></p>
        <p>= The read and write operations in a file can be done by using some commands. But the module which is
            required
            to perform these operations is to be imported. The required module is ‘fs’ which is called as File System
            module in JavaScript. <br>
            The read and write operations in a file can be done by using some commands. But the module which is required
            to perform these operations is to be imported. The required module is ‘fs’ which is called as File System
            module in JavaScript. <br>
            After the File System file is imported then, the writeFile() operation is called. The writeFile() method is
            used to write into the file in JavaScript. The syntax of this method is as follows −<br>
            code:=> <br>
            writeFile(path,inputData,callBackFunction) <br>
            Path − The first parameter is the path of the file or the name of the file into which the input data is to
            be written.
            If there is a file already, then the contents in the file are deleted and the input which is given by the
            user will get updated or if
            the file is not present, then the file with that will be created in the given path and the input information
            is written into it. <br>
            inputData − The second parameter is the input data which contains the data to be written in the file that is
            opened. <br>
            callBackFuntion − The third parameter is the function which is the call back function which takes the error
            as the parameter
            and shows the fault if the write operation fails. <br>
        </p> <br>

        <p><b>11. What are all the looping structures in Javascript?</b></p>
        <p>= Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly.You can think of a loop as a computerized
            version of the game where you tell someone to
            take X steps in one direction, then Y steps in another. For example, the idea "Go five steps to the east"
            could be expressed this way as a loop:
            1> For loop: <br>

            A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. <br>
            When a for loop executes, the following occurs: <br>
            - The initializing expression initialExpression, if any, is executed. This expression usually initializes
            one or more loop counters, but the syntax allows
            an expression of any degree of complexity. This expression can also declare variables. <br>
            - The conditionExpression expression is evaluated. If the value of conditionExpression is true, the loop
            statements execute. Otherwise, the for loop
            terminates. (If the conditionExpression expression is omitted entirely, the condition is assumed to be
            true.) <br>
            - The statement executes. To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ }) to group those
            statements. <br>
            - If present, the update expression incrementExpression is executed.
            - Control returns to Step 2. <br><br>

            2> do.....while loop <br>
            The do...while statement repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. <br>
            A do...while statement looks as follows: <br>
            do <br>
            statement <br>
            while (condition);<br>
            statement is always executed once before the condition is checked. (To execute multiple statements, use a
            block statement ({ }) to group those statements.) <br>
            If condition is true, the statement executes again. At the end of every execution, the condition is checked.
            When the condition is false, execution stops,<br>
            and control passes to the statement following do...while. <br>
            Example:=> <br>
            In the following example, the do loop iterates at least once and reiterates until i is no longer less than
            5. <br>

            let i = 0;<br>
            do { <br>
            i += 1; <br>
            console.log(i); <br>
            } while (i &lt; 5);<br><br>

            3> while loop: <br>
            A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. <br>
            If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the
            statement following the loop. <br>
            The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement
            is executed and the condition is tested again. <br>
            If the condition returns false, execution stops, and control is passed to the statement following while.
            <br>
            Example :=> <br>
            The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than 3: <br>
            let n = 0; <br>
            let x = 0; <br>
            while (n &lt; 3) { <br>
            n++; <br>
            x += n; <br>
            } <br><br>
            4> for in loop: <br>
            The for...in statement iterates a specified variable over all the enumerable properties of an object. <br>
            Example: <br>
            The following function takes as its argument an object and the object's name. It then iterates over all the
            object's properties and returns a string that lists the property names and their values. <br>
            function dumpProps(obj, objName) { <br>
            let result = ''; <br>
            for (const i in obj) { <br>
            result += `${objName}.${i} = ${obj[i]}&lt;br&gt;`; <br>
            } <br>
            result += '&lt;hr&gt;';
            return result; <br>
            } <br><br>
            5> for....of loop: <br>
            The for...of statement creates a loop Iterating over iterable objects (including Array, Map, Set, arguments
            object and so on),<br>
            invoking a custom iteration hook with statements to be executed for the value of each distinct property.
            <br>
            structure:=. <br>
            for (variable of object) <br>
            statement <br>
            The for...of and for...in statements can also be used with destructuring. <br>
        </p>

        <p><b>12. How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in Javascript?</b></p>
        <p>= In JavaScript parseInt() function (or a method) is used to convert the passed in string parameter or value
            to an integer value itself. <br>
            This function returns an integer of base which is specified in second argument of parseInt() function. <br>
            In JavaScript parseInt() function (or a method) is used to convert the passed in string parameter or value
            to an integ er value itself. <br>
            This function returns an integer of base which is specified in second argument of parseInt() function.
            JavaScript parseInt() function returns Nan
            ( not a number) when the string doesn’t contain number. <br>
            strucure: <br>
            parseInt(Value, radix) <br>
            It accepts a string as a value and converts it to specified radix system (any desired numerical value passed
            by a user) and returns an integer
            (corresponding to the passed in numerical radix value). Program to convert string to integer: <br>
        </p> <br>


        <p><b>13. What is the function of the delete operator ?</b></p>
        <p>= The delete operator removes a property from an object. If the property’s value is an object and there are
            no more references to the object, the object held by that property is eventually released automatically.</p>
        <br>

        <p><b>14. What are the all types of Pop up boxes available in javascript ?</b></p>
        <p> = There are three types of Pop up boxes: <br>
            = Alert Box :- it’s just displays a message with an ok button. <br>
            = Syntax:- <br>
            = Alert(“you are alert here”) <br>
            = Confirm Box:- A Confirmation message window with the ok And cancel button Pop up . <br>
            = Syntax:-h <br>
            = Confirm(“your quary here”) <br>
            = Prompt Box :- it’s Pop up a dialog Box asking the user to input followed confirmation button. <br>
            = Syntax:- <br>
            = Prompt Box(“your prompt here”) <br>
        </p> <br>

        <p><b>15. What is the use of Void (0)?</b></p>
        <p>=  Using javascript: , you can run code that does not change the current page. This, used with void(0) means, do nothing - don't reload, don't navigate, do not run any code. <br>
            The "Link" word is treated as a link by the browser. For example, it's focusable, but it doesn't navigate to a new page. <br>
            You might have occasionally came across “javascript:void(0)” in an HTML Document. It is often used when inserting an expression in a web page might produce some
            unwanted effect. <br> To remove this effect, “javascript:void(0)” is used. This expression returns undefined primitive value. This is often used with hyperlinks. <br> Sometimes,
            you will decide to call some JavaScript from inside a link. Normally, when you click a link, the browser loads a brand new page or refreshes the same page
            (depending on the URL specified). But you most likely don’t desire this to happen if you have hooked up some JavaScript thereto link.
            To prevent the page from refreshing, you could use void(0). Using “#” in anchor tag: When writing the following code in the editor, the web page is refreshed after the
            alert message is shown.
            </p><br>


            <p><b>16. How can a page be forced to load to another page in Javascript?</b></p>
            <p>=Approach: We can use window. location property inside the script tag to forcefully load another page in Javascript. <br> It is a reference to a Location object that is it
                represents the current location of the document. We can change the URL of a window by accessing it. <br>
                We can use window.location property inside the script tag to forcefully load another page in Javascript. It is a reference to a Location object that is it represents the
                current location of the document. We can change the URL of a window by accessing it. <br>
                Example:=> <br>
                &lt;script&gt; <br>
                window.location = &lt;Path / URL&lt; <br>
                &lt;/script&gt; <br>
                </p> <br>

                <p><b>17. What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in Javascript?</b></p>
                <p>=  The use of innerHTML very slow: The process of using innerHTML is much slower as its contents as slowly built, also already parsed contents and elements are
                    also re-parsed which takes time. <br>
                    -  Preserves event handlers attached to any DOM elements: The event handlers do not get attached to the new elements created by setting innerHTML
                    automatically. To do so one has to keep track of the event handlers and attach it to new elements manually. This may cause a memory leak on some browsers. <br>
                    - Content is replaced everywhere: Either you add, append, delete or modify contents on a webpage using innerHTML, all contents is replaced,
                    also all the DOM nodes inside that element are reparsed and recreated. <br>
                    - Appending to innerHTML is not supported: Usually, += is used for appending in JavaScript. But on appending to an Html tag using innerHTML,
                    the whole tag is re-parsed. <br>
                    - Old content replaced issue: The old content is replaced even if object.innerHTML = object.innerHTML + ‘html’ is used instead of <br>
                    - object.innerHTML += ‘html’. There is no way of appending without reparsing the whole innerHTML. Therefore, working with innerHTML becomes very slow. <br>
                    - String concatenation just does not scale when dynamic DOM elements need to be created as the plus’ and quote openings and closings becomes difficult to track. <br>
                    - Can break the document: There is no proper validation provided by innerHTML, so any valid HTML code can be used. This may break the document of JavaScript. 
                    Even broken HTML can be used, which may lead to unexpected problems. <br>
                    - Can also be used for Cross-site Scripting(XSS): The fact that innerHTML can add text and elements to the webpage, can easily be used by malicious users to
                    manipulate and display undesirable or harmful elements within other HTML element tags. Cross-site Scripting may also lead to loss, leak and change of sensitive
                    information. <br>
